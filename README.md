# Startpage Firefox Extension

It's available at Firefox Add-ons: <https://addons.mozilla.org/ja/firefox/addon/startpage-title-ext-firefox/>

*Note: This is a port of the original Chrome extension created by Yasunori Mahata. I only tested and verified that it works on Firefox without any modifications.*
